# interp-eopl

Some interpreters written in Clojure while I was reading [EOPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentials_of_Programming_Languages) this summer.

They're horrible organized into files instead of branches because I wanted to work on them at the same time,
but I probably should have just maintained separate clones. Sorry, future self.
